# Vegetation-Memory-Causes

## DESCRIPTION: 
Within this study, we build on my (Erik Kusch) recent research of global dryland vegetation memory patterns. Throughout this previous study, I identified a lack of global generalisations of vegetation memory processes. Using novel data products, we are now increasing both the spatial and temporal resolution of vegetation memory assessments in order to link these remote sensed proxies of ecosystem resilience to (1) local abiotic regimes, (2) plant functional expressions, and (3) life history strategies. This should enable us to explain certain processes which enable different expressions of intrinsic and extrinsic vegetation memory.

## PROJECT OUTLINE:
1. EVI Data:
  a) Obtain MOD13A2 vegetation data through the Google Earth Engine
  b) Pre-process MOD13A2 data within R
2. Climate Data:
  a) Download ERA5-Land data for Air Temperature and Soil Moisture
  b) Downscale ERA5-Land data to match spatial resolution of MOD13A2 using the kriging method
3. Vegetation Memory:
  a) Limit data to fglobal dryland regions as defined in Millenium Ecosystem Assesment
  b) Calculate vegetation memory as carried out in my previous study
4.) Link expressions of vegetation memory to:
  a) Abiotic regimes
  b) Plant Functional Traits
  c) Life History Traits
